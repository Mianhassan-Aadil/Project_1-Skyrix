# Project_1-Skyrix
This is a game that I made using functions, pointers, and arrays

In this game the user enters his/her name and then they are greeted with a prompt that tells a user to choose a weapon to battle a monster, they are presented with 10 options, only 10 of which are powerful enough to make you win the game. once you choose, You play rounds and the player and monster battle. IF you chose the right weapon. YOU'll WIN.

I'll still update the code once in a while to add other features too, ðŸ™‚
